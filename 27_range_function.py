# range function in python is used to generate a sequence of numbers.

# for i in range(8):          # (1, 8) starts from 1 to index number 8.
    # print(i)


for i in range(1, 8, 2):      # (1, 8, 2) step-size removes every 2nd number and by default it is 1 as(1, 8, 1)
    print(i)

# for i in range(1, 100, 9):
#    print(i)
