# A Tuple is an immutable(cannot change) data-type in python.

# Creating a tuple using ()
t = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
# t1 = ()              # empty tuple
# t1 = (1, )             # tuple with single element needs a comma
# print(t1)

# Printing the elements of a tuple 
# print(t[1])

# Cannot update the value of a tuple
t[0] = 34
print(t)


# Once defined a tuple's element cannot be altered or manipulated
